    Shen is a portable functional programming language that offers
    
    - pattern matching, 
    - |lambda| calculus consistency, 
    - macros, 
    - optional lazy evaluation, 
    - static type checking, 
    - an integrated fully functional Prolog, 
    - and an inbuilt compiler-compiler.
    
    Shen has one of the most powerful type systems within functional programming. Shen runs under a reduced instruction Lisp and is designed for portability. The word 'Shen' is Chinese for *spirit* and our motto reflects our desire to liberate our work to live under many platforms.
    
    Shen includes sources and is absolutely free for commercial use. It currently runs under CLisp and SBCL, Scheme and Javascript to follow.
