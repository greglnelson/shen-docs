This form is entirely optional. If you do not want to fill it out then click :doc:`here <download>` to go to the download page.

Part of the purpose of this form is to help to build up a research network of people who share your interests and with whom you may want to collaborate. Knowing people in your line of work can be a great help in commerce and in academia, so this form is definitely worth 5 minutes. The Shen/Qi network includes nearly 1,000 users. Here are just some of the fields represented in our database.

- numerical mathematics,
- game development
- bioinformatics
- natural language processing
- image/pattern recognition
- formal verification
- theorem proving
- planning
- simulation
- text understanding
- robotics
- user interfaces
- machine learning
- vision
- Lisp
- genetic programming
- Sanskrit
- AI
- operating systems
- semantic web
- data mining
- concurrency

If you want to share your interests with others, the tick the box labelled **Please put me in touch with people who share my research interests**. In that event, we send only your name, email and overlapping interests to people who you might want to work with. If you do not want to share any of your data, just do not tick the box. Your data is kept confidential.

Note as of 2011, this will be a free service as long as it does not soak up great amounts of support time. Should it prove to require significant investment of support, we may mail you asking for a small donation (say enough to buy us a pizza a month) to keep this going.
