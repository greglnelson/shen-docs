Legal Status and Rules of the Committee
---------------------------------------

The committee exists purely as an advisory body until the decease or incapacity of Dr Mark Tarver. In that event, with Dr Tarver ceasing to be chairman, the following procedures and rules will be put into effect.

#. The vice-chairman (currently Vasil Diadov) will become chairman and the deputy vice-chairman (currently Kian Wilcox) will become vice-chairman.
#. All particulars relating to Lambda Associates, the Shen website (shenlanguage.org), Google Newsgroups, and Paypal, including passwords, will be given to the chairman.
#. Copyright and control of the license and Shen specification will be given to the committee.
#. As copyright holder the committee will be empowered to change the license or the Shen specification. Such a change requires a majority vote of the committee. By 'majority vote' we understand that the majority of the *whole* committee must be in favour of the motion.
#. In the event of a tie, the chairman has the casting vote.
#. In the event of the death or resignation of the chairman, the vice-chairman will take his position and the committee will elect a new vice-chairman by majority vote.
#. The numbers in the committee shall not be less than 5 or more than 12. In the case that numbers fall below the minimum, the committee shall elect by majority vote a new member.
#. Membership of the committee shall require past service to the Shen project. Anybody is eligible for election to the committee, but selection must depend on a majority vote in favour.
#. In the event that system of voluntary payments to Lambda Associates/Shen is retained, the proceeds should be used to further the dissemination of Shen in a way that is agreeable to the committee. The chairman is *guardian* of this account and should be prepared to share information with the committee members about it, but the monies therein are to be dispensed only at the behest of the majority vote.
