Numbers
=======

Numbers in Shen are positive, negative or zero and either whole or floating point. The negative number ``-3`` is just written ``'-3'``. Cancellation is used so that ``--3`` is read as ``3``. Integer numbers are treated as a subclass of floating points so that ``1 = 1.0`` is true.

In Shen ``(- 3)`` is actually an application of two place subtraction to 3 and produces, not a number, but an object called a closure.

Shen includes ``/``, ``*``, ``+`` ,and ``*``.

``/`` produces a float if the divisor is not a factor. Both ``*`` and ``+`` are polyadic; that is they take an arbitrary number of arguments.

The Shen standard maths library includes functions for trigonometry and for generating random numbers, and includes the functionality of the standard C++ maths library.

Shen versions 2.0 and greater will accept **e notation**; ``6.0221418e23`` is equivalent to ``6.0221418Ã—1023``
