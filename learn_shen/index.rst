Learn Shen
**********

There are two ways of learning Shen.

- Fast track learning.
- From the basics.

Fast Track Learning
-------------------

Fast track learning is for people who already know functional programming and want to begin programming with Shen. We recommend you do the following.

- Read the `15 minute tutorial for experienced functional programmers`_
- Use the resources of fast reference on the left for key ideas.
- Look up the guide for :ref:`system_functions` when needed.

More advanced material dealing with sequent calculus etc. requires deeper study. At the bottom of every *fast reference* precis page, there are a list of references drawn from the *detailed references resources*. This includes

- the 400 page `Functional Programming in Qi`_, which in many aspects is still a very good guide to Shen. This online edition has been annotated to show the changes introduced in Shen.
- the latest official Shen specification
- as well as online sources such as Wikipedia.

Learning from the Basics
------------------------

If you have no experience in functional programming then read `Functional Programming in Qi`_ which teaches functional programming from the ground up. This online edition has been annotated to show the changes introduced in Shen and it is trivial to migrate to Shen from Qi.
